# Gangrene Prediction Model

This machine learning model is designed to predict whether a foot is affected by gangrene and to identify the specific type of gangrene: dry, wet, or gas, or to determine if the foot is normal.

## Overview

Gangrene is a serious medical condition that occurs when body tissue dies due to lack of blood flow or a severe bacterial infection. It typically affects the extremities, such as the feet and hands. Early detection and treatment are crucial for preventing severe complications. Our model aims to assist medical professionals and individuals in identifying the presence and type of ga8ngrene using advanced machine learning techniques.

## Features

- **Prediction of Gangrene Presence**: Determines whether the foot has gangrene or is normal.
- **Classification of Gangrene Types**: Identifies the type of gangrene (dry, wet, gas) if present.
- **User-friendly Web Interface**: Easy-to-use interface for uploading foot images and viewing predictions.

## Prediction Examples

Here are examples of predictions made by our model for all four categories:

1. **Normal Foot**:
